Q:How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
A:I could see the mistake I had made in the previous version.
Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A:By looking at the previous versions of code, i will know
which mistakes I had made earlier, so I'll be cautious
not to repeat them.
Q:What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A:Pros: We decide when its right to commit rather than the computer 
automatically doing it.
Cons: Choosing how often to commit is a hurdle and we may commit
too soon or too late.
Q:Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A:It is better to have versions of all related files at the the time 
of committing even one.
Q:How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A:git log prints the info of all commits (most recent comes first)
and git diff f_id s_id displays the add/del of the lines.
Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A: If the current version of code is working perfectly, I
wouldn't think twice before adding a new feature to it
since even if i ended messing it up I know that I can 
revert to the previous version.
Q:Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
A:I'll use Git for the course Developing Android Apps.
