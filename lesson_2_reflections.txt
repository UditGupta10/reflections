Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: A '.git' file is created which is capable of holding commits.
This is required for creating commits.
Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Its an intermediate platform provided by git to add files which
need to be committed. The advantage is that rather than committing 
every file in the working directory, we can choose the bunch of
files which need to be committed.
