Q:What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: A '.git' file is created which is capable of holding commits.
This is required for creating commits.
Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Its an intermediate platform provided by git to add files which
need to be committed. The advantage is that rather than committing 
every file in the working directory, we can choose the bunch of
files which need to be committed.
Q:How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A:If we only add the file in which the change has been made to the staging area then we commit the changes for that file only.
Q:What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A:Branches help when we are working on an experimental feature.
If its required from us to take up a serious issue we can go back
to the working version, solve the issue, and come back again to work on the experimental feature.
Q:How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A: The diagrams proved to be very effective in the explanation of
the concept of branching, 'detached head'.
Q:What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
A:We can inculcate changes from 2 branches by merging them. The merged 
commit has 2 parents therefore.
Q:What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
A: The advantage I see with git's merge is that it automatically merges only when its
completely sure that the branches being merged don't behave differently, else it declines
the merge and raises a conflict alarm to let us know and resolve it manually.
